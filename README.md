### 1. Variational Recurrent Neural Network

Code adapted from [https://github.com/emited/VariationalRecurrentNeuralNetwork](https://github.com/emited/VariationalRecurrentNeuralNetwork)

Variational RNN (VRNN), from *A Recurrent Latent Variable Model for Sequential Data*.


The paper is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02216).

##### Things to figure out
1. Run on Imperial DOC GPU for experiments
2. Deconvolution layer
3. Print out output in a nicer way - how to work with Moving MNIST

Specifically for Step 2., figure out reparameterisation trick for VAEs. What does it mean to have a separate linear layer for mean and variance?
